AI-Powered Predictive Auto-Scaling with GitOps for Microservices

This project demonstrates a conceptual framework for an AI-powered predictive auto-scaling system for microservices deployed on Kubernetes, managed with GitOps. It leverages Machine Learning to forecast resource demands and automates deployment using Argo CD.

Note: This project provides a foundational setup. The custom controller is a conceptual sketch and would require significant development to become a fully functional, production-ready Kubernetes operator. The ML model is also simplified for demonstration purposes.
Project Components:

    Local Kubernetes Cluster: Minikube for local development.

    Monitoring Stack: Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.

    ML Model Serving: A Python Flask application serving a simplified time-series prediction model, containerized with Docker.

    Conceptual Predictive Auto-Scaler Controller: A Python script demonstrating how a controller would interact with the ML model and Kubernetes API.

    GitOps with Argo CD: Automating the deployment of all Kubernetes manifests from a Git repository.

Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

    Docker Desktop (or another virtualization software like VirtualBox, Hyper-V)

    kubectl: Kubernetes command-line tool

    minikube: Local Kubernetes cluster

    Python 3.8+ and pip

    Git

1. Project Setup - Get the Files

Create a new directory for your project and save the following content into files with the specified names:

    README.md (this file)

    prometheus-grafana-stack.yaml

    ml_model_app.py

    Dockerfile

    requirements.txt

    ml-serving-deployment.yaml

    predictive_scaler_controller.py

    argocd-application.yaml

2. Start Minikube Cluster

Open your terminal and start your local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.

minikube start --driver=docker # Or choose your preferred driver like virtualbox, hyperv

Verify that your cluster is running:

minikube status
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes

(Optional) Enable Minikube Dashboard:

minikube addons enable dashboard
minikube dashboard # Opens the Kubernetes dashboard in your browser

3. Build and Prepare the ML Model Serving Application

First, you need to train the simple ML model and build its Docker image.

    Install Python Dependencies (locally for model training):
    Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Train and Save the ML Model:
    Run the ml_model_app.py script once. This will generate a predictive_cpu_model.pkl file, which is the trained model. You can stop the script after the file is created.

    python ml_model_app.py

    Build Docker Image for ML App (into Minikube's Docker daemon):
    Minikube runs its own Docker daemon. To make the image available inside Minikube, you need to point your shell to Minikube's Docker environment before building.

    eval $(minikube docker-env)
    docker build -t ml-predictive-scaler-app .
    eval $(minikube docker-env -u) # Unset the environment variables after building

    This ensures the ml-predictive-scaler-app:latest image is available to Minikube.

4. Deploy Monitoring Stack (Prometheus & Grafana)

Apply the Kubernetes manifests for Prometheus and Grafana.

kubectl apply -f prometheus-grafana-stack.yaml

Verify the deployments:

kubectl get pods -n monitoring
kubectl get svc -n monitoring

Access Prometheus and Grafana:

    Get Minikube IP: minikube ip

    Prometheus UI: http://<minikube-ip>:30000

    Grafana UI: http://<minikube-ip>:30001 (Login: admin / prom-operator)

5. Deploy ML Model Serving Application to Kubernetes

Apply the Kubernetes manifests for your Flask ML application.

kubectl apply -f ml-serving-deployment.yaml

Verify the deployment:

kubectl get pods -l app=ml-predictive-scaler
kubectl get svc ml-predictive-scaler-service

You can test the internal service from within Minikube (e.g., by exec-ing into a pod and using curl).
6. Set up GitOps with Argo CD

    Install Argo CD:

    kubectl create namespace argocd
    kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

    Access Argo CD UI:

        Forward the Argo CD server port:

        kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443

        Open your browser to https://localhost:8080.

        Get initial admin password:

        kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo

        The username is admin.

    Create a Git Repository:
    Create a new public Git repository (e.g., on GitHub) named my-devops-project-configs.

    Add Kubernetes Manifests to your Git Repository:
    Commit the prometheus-grafana-stack.yaml and ml-serving-deployment.yaml files to your newly created Git repository.

    Configure Argo CD Application:
    IMPORTANT: Before applying argocd-application.yaml, open the file and replace <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME> with your actual GitHub username (or the full URL to your repository if it's not GitHub).

    kubectl apply -n argocd -f argocd-application.yaml

    Go to the Argo CD UI (https://localhost:8080). You should see your devops-project-app syncing and deploying the resources from your Git repository.

7. Run the Conceptual Predictive Auto-Scaler Controller

This is the Python script that conceptually acts as your custom controller.

    Install Kubernetes Python Client:

    pip install kubernetes

    Run the Controller Script:
    Open a new terminal window (keep Minikube and Argo CD port-forwarding running) and execute the controller script:

    python predictive_scaler_controller.py

    You will see output indicating that it's "reconciling" the ml-predictive-scaler deployment and making mock calls to the ML model and Prometheus.

Next Steps & Further Development:

    Refine the ML Model:

        Use real historical metrics from Prometheus (e.g., export data to a CSV or connect directly to Prometheus API).

        Implement more advanced time series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).

        Integrate MLOps tools like MLflow for experiment tracking, model versioning, and lifecycle management.

    Develop a Robust Custom Controller:

        Learn client-go (Go) or operator-sdk (Python) to build a proper Kubernetes Operator.

        Implement actual Prometheus queries within the controller to fetch real-time metrics.

        Define a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for your predictive scaler, allowing users to declaratively define which deployments should be predictively scaled.

        Implement sophisticated scaling logic based on predicted values and configurable thresholds.

    Simulate Load:

        Create a simple application that generates varying levels of load (e.g., using hey, locust, or a custom load generator) to test the auto-scaler's responsiveness.

    CI/CD for ML Model Updates:

        Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) that automatically retrains the ML model, builds a new Docker image, pushes it to a container registry, and then updates the ml-serving-deployment.yaml in your Git repository. Argo CD will then automatically pick up this change and deploy the new model version.

    Advanced Monitoring:

        Create custom Grafana dashboards to visualize predicted vs. actual resource usage, scaling events, and ML model performance metrics.
